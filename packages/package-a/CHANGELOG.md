  Today is gonna be the day that we're gonna throw it back to you

  Right now is trying somehow to not make bad puns at you

  ```
  some nights I stay up, packaging my bad code
  Some nights I call it awful

  Some nights I wish that my builds would all just pass now
  Some nights I wish they'd all just stop

  But I still get up
  I still read old code
  And I still don't know what it all does

  What does this code do?
  When does this code run?

  Most nights, I don't know
  Anymore
  ```
